Playey is a Netherlands and free-to-play project on Scratch, thats open-source and no-profit where you can play games and publish them. Its web-based, that means that you *dont need to download stuff*

## Is my system compatible for Playey?

If your system has a browser, like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/nl_nl/chrome/), Firefox or Opera with a internet connection then your system should be compatible. If not, let me know with a issue.
